# FindDining

### University Project: Django Website

FindDining was a five person group project to develop a product over the course of a month. 

The project we chose and developed suggested restaurants to a user by querying the Google Places & Details APIs. It sorted this information so that personalized questions could be asked to provide the user with a suggestion tailored for them.

It is shown here __not functional__ as the apikey and secret key needed to be removed. For experience showcase purposes only.
